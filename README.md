Curveball is a curve generator tool for [Neverball] level developers.

This repository contains the Curveball curve generator engine `lib-curveball` and the graphical tool `curveball`.

You can run `curveball` on your machine, or you can use it on the web.

You can use `lib-curveball` as a library in your own curve generating tools.

Curveball produces Quake3 map data you can copy and paste into a program like [Trenchbroom].

## Features

Curveball generates a wider variety of curves than what is possible with [curve.c].

Curveball supports generating these curves:

- Curve Classic
- Curve Slope
- Rayto
- Extrusion

### Curve Classic

Curve Classic contains the same functionality as [curve.c] when `slope` is disabled. It produces circular arcs.

### Curve Slope

Curve Classic contains the same functionality as [curve.c] when `slope` is enabled, with a little more flexibility.

### Rayto

An oddity in the set of curves Curveball produces, **Rayto** fills in the "negative space" left by a circular arc. The resulting shape is useful for avoiding [T-intersections](https://icculus.org/neverball/mapping/) when constructing maps.

### Extrusion

The **Extrusion** tool generates curves in a manner inspired by mechanical CAD sofware. The tool allows you to select one of the following 2D profiles:

- Circle
- Circle sector
- Rectangle
- Parallelogram
- Annulus
- Any arbitrary set of convex polygons

The tool will extrude these 2D profiles along one of the following paths in 3D space:

- Line
- Revolve
- Sinusoid
- Bezier
- Catenary
- Serpentine

## Installation

First, see if [Curveball on the Web] meets your needs.

For a local installation, consider downloading one of the releases in Github. Alternatively, you may
compile from source.

## Compiling

First, install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Then, use [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) to build the software.

For example, `cargo run --bin curveball --release` will compile and run **curveball** in release mode.

You may also use `cargo install` to install the software. See [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-install.html) for more information.

## Using Curveball in your own script

You may want to write your own curve generating scripts and use Curveball to help. To do this:

1. Make a new package with `cargo new`

2. Add Curveball with `cargo add lib-curveball`

3. Use the [examples](lib-curveball/examples/) to get started

You can use `lib-curveball` to:

- Generate brushes directly from points, or

- Define your own profile or path and calling `extrude()`

## Compiling for distribution

Building for distribution requires you to be set up for cross-compilation and compiling for the web. Dependencies include:

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) - a more convenient Makefile
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/) - to create a website with WASM
- [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) - for simple cross-compilation; requires Docker or Podman

You will also need to add targets for `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` with `rustup target add <TARGET>`.

Distribution simply requires running the `justfile`:

```
just build-linux
just build-windows
just build-web
```

## Project Structure

Curveball is written in Rust.

This repository is a Cargo workspace with the following crates:

- `curveball` - Binary crate; compiles to the GUI tool.
- `lib-curveball` - Library crate containing functions to generate the various curves.

## Is it any good?

Yes.

### Notice

Future versions may be released under a different license. [Neverball] is licensed under the terms of GPLv2, so if Curveball ever makes use of [Neverball] assets or code, it will need to be released under a GPL license, too.

A license change will result in a major version bump.
